# SearchMenuAnim
Searching…
The material design spec says¹ that “transitioning between two visual states should be clear, smooth and effortless and not confuse the user”.  That's why when I came across this shot² on dribbble I thought it was a pretty funky way to transition from a search icon to a search field.  I then thought that with AnimatedVectorDrawable's³ ability to animate paths, this would be simple.  +Chris Banes said I was crazy so then I had to make it to prove him wrong.
